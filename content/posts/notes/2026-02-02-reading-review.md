## Scope & Categories

- Financial Product Knowledge: How risk is embedded, transferred, or amplified within financial structures.
- Risk Knowledge & Frameworks: Cross-cutting concepts spanning credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk.
- Where metrics inform decision-making—and where they break down.
- Regulatory Guidance: Translating supervisory expectations into practical risk insights.


## Reading Notes (example)

- Book/Article: *Title A* — Key insight: how a simple model assumption masks tail dependence in shock scenarios.
- Book/Article: *Title B* — Key insight: governance and the limits of disclosure in rapid policy regimes.


## Why this matters

Reading non-fiction that connects institutional behavior, regulatory shifts, and market structure helps ground abstract models in observable mechanisms. These reviews are short, annotated, and intended as pointers for further research.
