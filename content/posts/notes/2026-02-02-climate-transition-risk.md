## Climate Driver

**Transition Risk** is driven by changes in climate-related policies, technologies, and market preferences, rather than physical climate impacts. Key drivers include:

- Carbon pricing and emissions regulation
- Mandatory disclosure and capital requirements
- Rapid technological substitution (e.g., renewables vs fossil fuels)

---

## Risk Transmission

Transition risk primarily enters the risk framework through credit and valuation channels, not merely environmental metrics. Key transmission mechanisms:

1. Cash flow disruption: policy changes alter operating costs and demand, affecting debt service capacity.
2. Asset stranding: long-lived assets may lose economic value before maturity.
3. Credit migration: abrupt changes in regulatory expectations can trigger rating downgrades.
4. Correlation shifts: firms exposed to similar transition pathways become more correlated under stress.

Importantly, these effects tend to be non-linear and policy-driven rather than gradually priced in.

## Time Horizon

Transition risk does not follow a smooth long-term horizon.

- Short term: regulatory announcements, stress test expectations, disclosure rules
- Medium term: capital reallocation, refinancing risk, changes in market access
- Long term: structural decline of carbon-intensive business models

Risk materialisation often occurs through policy-triggered repricing rather than slow deterioration.

## Why It Matters

Traditional risk models often underestimate transition risk because:

- Historical data does not reflect future policy regimes
- PD/LGD models assume stable business models
- Stress testing focuses on macro variables, not regulatory shocks

As a result, transition risk behaves more like an abrupt policy shock than a conventional cyclical risk factor.

## Open Questions

- How should banks distinguish between transitional stress and permanent credit impairment?
- Can scenario analysis meaningfully inform capital decisions, or is it primarily a governance tool?
- How should risk appetite frameworks reflect policy uncertainty rather than climate outcomes?
