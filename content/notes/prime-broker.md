## What Prime Brokers Do

Prime brokers provide financing, custody, clearing, and execution services to hedge funds and institutional clients. They sit at the center of leverage creation.

## Risk Concentration

Prime brokerage risk arises from:

- Margin lending
- Rehypothecation
- Client correlation during stress

Losses often emerge not from a single default, but from *simultaneous deleveraging*.

## Key Lesson

Prime brokerage is a classic example where legal exposure understates economic risk.
