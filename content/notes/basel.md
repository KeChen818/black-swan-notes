## What Basel Is (and Is Not)

The Basel Framework is a set of international banking standards designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks. It is not just a capital formula. It is a governance and risk-discipline framework.

## Core Pillars

- Pillar 1: Minimum capital requirements
- Pillar 2: Supervisory review and internal risk processes
- Pillar 3: Market discipline through disclosure

Together, these pillars aim to align risk-taking with capital resilience.

## Key Insight

Basel works best when internal risk identification is strong. Weak internal risk frameworks cannot be fixed by capital alone.
