## What is RCSA

Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) is a foundational risk management framework used to identify, assess, and monitor operational risks through a structured evaluation of key risks and the controls designed to mitigate them. Rather than relying solely on historical loss data, RCSA focuses on *forward-looking risk identification*.

## Why RCSA Matters

RCSA helps institutions:

- Surface non-obvious operational risks
- Assess control design and effectiveness
- Allocate accountability across the business
- Support regulatory expectations on risk governance

Its strength lies in combining business judgment with structured discipline.

## Key Limitation

RCSA quality is highly dependent on:

- Risk taxonomy clarity
- Participant incentives
- Governance challenge

Without strong oversight, RCSA can degrade into a box-ticking exercise.
