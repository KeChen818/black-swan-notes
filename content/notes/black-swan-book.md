## Central Thesis

Most impactful events in history are:

- Rare
- Extreme
- Retrospectively explainable

Traditional models systematically underestimate their importance.

## Why This Matters for Risk

Black Swan thinking challenges:

- Gaussian assumptions
- False confidence in forecasts

## Practical Risk Insight

Risk frameworks should focus less on precise prediction and more on resilience, optionality, and damage containment.
