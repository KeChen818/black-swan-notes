## Why It Matters

Traditional risk metrics often fail to capture step-in risk because:

- Legal boundaries are assumed binding under all conditions
- Historical loss data excludes implicit support events
- Capital frameworks focus on contractual exposures

Step-in risk therefore represents a governance and contingent-liability problem rather than a simple modelling deficiency.

## Open Questions

- How should institutions identify step-in risk ex ante without overestimating support expectations?
- Should step-in risk be reflected in capital, liquidity, or risk appetite frameworks?
- How can governance structures credibly enforce non-support commitments under stress?
