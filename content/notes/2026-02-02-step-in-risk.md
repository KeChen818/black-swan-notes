## Context

Step-in risk refers to the chance that a financial institution provides financial or non-financial support to an entity beyond contractual obligations, typically under stress. This often arises in structures intended to be legally remote—such as sponsored vehicles, funds, or affiliates—where market expectations, reputational concerns, or strategic interests create pressure to intervene.

## Risk Transmission

Step-in risk enters the risk framework through contagion and boundary erosion rather than explicit exposures. Key transmission channels include:

1. Implicit guarantees: market participants assume support despite the absence of contractual obligations.
2. Failure to provide support may damage franchise value or market access.
3. Liquidity stress propagation: support may take the form of liquidity provision during market dislocation.
4. Capital impact: unexpected support can weaken capital ratios and risk appetite.

Crucially, step-in risk materialises during stress and can be discontinuous.

## Time Horizon

Step-in risk is typically latent during normal conditions and becomes relevant only under stress.

- Normal times: no observable exposure; risk remains off-balance-sheet.
- Stress events: rapid escalation due to market or client expectations.
- Post-stress: structural reassessment of boundaries and governance.

## Why It Matters

Traditional risk metrics often fail to capture step-in risk because:

- Legal boundaries are assumed binding under all conditions
- Historical loss data excludes implicit support events
- Capital frameworks focus on contractual exposures

Step-in risk therefore represents a governance and contingent-liability problem rather than a simple modelling deficiency.

## Open Questions

- How should institutions identify step-in risk ex ante without overestimating support expectations?
- Should step-in risk be reflected in capital, liquidity, or risk appetite frameworks?
- How can governance structures credibly enforce non-support commitments under stress?
