## Context

Counterparty default risk refers to the risk of loss arising from a counterparty's failure to meet contractual obligations. It is often embedded in derivatives, securities financing, and guarantees and is characterised by exposure uncertainty, particularly under stressed market conditions.

## Risk Transmission

Counterparty default risk propagates through the financial system via:

1. Market stress increasing replacement costs when default risk rises.
2. Collateral dynamics: margin calls, haircuts, and collateral quality changes amplify liquidity pressure.
3. Wrong-way risk: counterparty credit quality deteriorates as exposure increases.
4. Contagion effects: default of a large counterparty transmits stress across interconnected institutions.

Losses therefore depend not only on default probability but on market conditions at the time of default.

## Time Horizon

Counterparty default risk is state-dependent and often materialises abruptly.

- Normal conditions: exposure appears well-collateralised and manageable.
- Stress periods: rapid exposure growth and collateral shortfalls.
- Post-default: legal, settlement, and replacement risks dominate realised losses.

## Why It Matters

Standard credit approaches may underestimate counterparty default risk because:

- Exposure is treated as static or averaged over time
- Correlation between market moves and counterparty credit quality is under-modelled
- Netting and collateral assumptions can break down under stress

Counterparty default risk thus behaves more like a systemically contingent factor than a simple bilateral credit loss.
