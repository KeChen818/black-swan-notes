Black Swan events are rare, high-impact occurrences that fall outside standard risk expectations and are often rationalized only after the fact. The key insight is not prediction failure, but model fragility — systems optimized for efficiency tend to amplify losses when exposed to extreme uncertainty. Risk management should therefore focus less on forecasting specific events and more on identifying structural vulnerabilities, convexity, and hidden assumptions.
