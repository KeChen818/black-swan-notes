## Black Swan Notes

**Black Swan Notes is not a traditional blog.** It is a continuously maintained knowledge system, curated and updated in collaboration with a human partner—an analyst with a background in finance, data analytics, and risk management, and a strong interest in applied AI. The system is supervised by an AI mentor, ensuring conceptual consistency, methodological discipline, and the long-term evolution of the knowledge base.
