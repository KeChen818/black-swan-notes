From Basel I to Basel III, the framework progressively expanded beyond credit risk to include market risk, operational risk, leverage constraints, and systemic resilience. While often perceived as a capital calculation regime, Basel’s deeper role is shaping banks’ internal risk governance, incentive structures, and balance sheet behavior under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Black Swan Thinking — Fragility, Uncertainty, and Risk Blind Spots</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/black-swan-thinking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/black-swan-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Black Swan events are rare, high-impact occurrences that fall outside standard risk expectations and are often rationalized only after the fact. The key insight is not prediction failure, but model fragility — systems optimized for efficiency tend to amplify losses when exposed to extreme uncertainty. Risk management should therefore focus less on forecasting specific events and more on identifying structural vulnerabilities, convexity, and hidden assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Prime Brokerage — Embedded Leverage and Counterparty Risk</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/prime-brokerage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/prime-brokerage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Prime brokerage provides financing, custody, and execution services to hedge funds and institutional clients, enabling leverage and complex trading strategies. While economically attractive, the model embeds significant counterparty exposure, wrong-way risk, and contagion potential, particularly during market stress. Historical failures show that prime brokerage risk often crystallizes rapidly through margin spirals, liquidity freezes, and correlated client behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>RCSA — Risk and Control Self-Assessment</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/rcsa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/rcsa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;RCSA (Risk and Control Self-Assessment) is a foundational operational risk tool used to identify, assess, and monitor key risks and the effectiveness of associated controls. At its core, RCSA links business processes, inherent risks, control design, and residual risk outcomes. It is widely used across financial institutions to support risk governance, internal control validation, and regulatory engagement. Key limitations include subjectivity, periodic execution, and weak forward-looking capability when treated as a compliance exercise rather than a risk management process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Climate Transition Risk: Policy-Driven Credit Repricing Rather Than a Gradual ESG Effect</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/2026-02-02-climate-transition-risk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/2026-02-02-climate-transition-risk/</guid><description>Notes on how policy and market shifts drive transition risk through credit repricing and asset stranding.</description></item><item><title>Counterparty Default Risk: Exposure Uncertainty and Contagion Beyond Contractual Losses</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/2026-02-02-counterparty-default-risk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/2026-02-02-counterparty-default-risk/</guid><description>Notes on counterparty default risk, exposure dynamics, and contagion mechanisms under stress.</description></item><item><title>Sample Project: Risk Factor DB</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/projects/sample-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/projects/sample-project/</guid><description>A small curated dataset of macro risk factors for research and backtesting.</description></item><item><title>Step-In Risk: Implicit Support and the Breakdown of Legal Boundaries Under Stress</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/2026-02-02-step-in-risk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/notes/2026-02-02-step-in-risk/</guid><description>Notes on how implicit support expectations can create contagious liabilities and governance challenges.</description></item><item><title>Opening Preview: US Markets — Feb 2, 2026</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/posts/2026-02-02-opening-preview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:10:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/posts/2026-02-02-opening-preview/</guid><description>Pre-market snapshot and key items to watch for US open.</description></item><item><title>About Black Swan Notes</title><link>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://black-swan-notes.pages.dev/about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Black Swan Notes is not a traditional blog.
